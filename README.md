#### - This can only run on macOS 10.14 or newer. I will try to support older macOS as soon as possible.

## Introduction

- This script is to apply an icon to your bootable volume.
- The icon can be seen in the Mac Boot Manager (Press Option while booting)

## How to use:

- Step 1: Download the attached file below.
- Step 2: Run the downloaded VolumeIcon.command script.

## Important

- This script is still in the beta stage so it might have some problems while executing.
- Sometimes due to the OS Version Check feature, the icon is not correctly applied.

- All the checking processes are now below the "Input Volume name" section for convenience. 
- Fixed the problem of temporary files are not removed correctly.
